                    <h1> Bleu Game Awards </h1>
                    <p> 
                        Welcome to the Bleu Game Awards where the players make the decisions and the player vote is 100% of the final 
                        score. The idea for the BGAs came from watching game award shows and just not agreeing with either the nominees 
                        or the final vote. Occasionally, the chosen games seemed a little sus, especially compared to the games that 
                        came out and the way they were rated upon release verses how they were recieved by the time the Awards Show 
                        came around. This lead to digging in to the background of learning about the Game Awards and how nominees are 
                        chosen and voted on. As it turns out, nominations and primary voting is done by a pannel of media judges who 
                        are picked by the big companies (Microsoft, Sony, EA, Ubisoft, etc.), basically, people who are paid to play 
                        these games. "Fan" voting only comprises 10% of the final vote, basically relegating popular opinion to tie 
                        breaking. So, in response, the Bleu Game Awards were born, with the first award show on December 12, 2020. In 
                        the BGAs, nominations and voting is all fan based. Each vote is weighed the same and all analysis and data is 
                        open and available to anyone wishing to peruse it.
