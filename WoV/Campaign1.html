                    <h2>Overview: </h2>
                    <p>
                        Though short, Campaign 1 was a first attempt at many things. It was Bleu's first run at being DM 
                        and all of his players were new players to the TTRPG world. It was a first attempt at streaming 
                        the campaign on Twitch. The campaign begins in the City of Eriath, a small city on the coast of the 
                        continent. The company goes on adventures and finds the beginings of a mystery...

                    <h2>Characters: </h2>
                    <h3>Primbesar Sularys (Barbarian): </h3>
                    <p>
                        Sularys is a Mercury Dragonborn. Raised by a tribe, Sularys was blessed to be able to raise the ritual 
                        hammer, Jhank Guth'orn. All promise of future leadership disapeared when the tribe was ambushed, leaving 
                        Sularys the only survivor. Alone and barely alive, she made her way to Eriath where she joined an 
                        adventuring group, hoping that she would one day discover the identity of those that attacked her clan.
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <h3>Fraeya Selevar&#252;n (Sorcerer/Rogue): </h3>
                    <p>
                        Fraeya is an Elven princess, though she hid her royal lineage outside her kingdom. When she was young, her 
                        mother was murdered; all investigations quickly led to dead ends and more questions than answers. 
                        Leveraging her position and connections, Fraeya began her own investigation when she was considered an 
                        adult. Her path led her to Eriath, where she met with an adventuring group that she decided to join to 
                        further her investigation.
                    </p>

                        Moxie is a Tiefling. After a few hard lessons while growing up, she found an outlet in music and 
                        decided to leave her village for the escape of the big city. Her motivations are her own, though she 
                        slowly found herself opening up to the animals who sought her out for friendship.
                    </p>

                        Mara is a Human who managed to get herself all but expelled from the Towers of Magic. She decided that 
                        her talents could still be of use to the right people, and ran into a group of adventurers in Eriath 
                        trying to save a child. Knowing that even though secrecy may be her best choice for survival, she couldn't 
                        leave a child to their fate. She joined the group of adventurers and began helping them in their quests.

                    <p>
                        Elios is an Elf. He was once a happy young Elven child until he got separated from his parents one day, 
                        leading to his capture and enslavement by goblins. He then spent much of his childhood serving goblins, 
                        until he was saved by a lone woodsman who decided to take the now young adult under his wing and train 
                        him to defend and save others. The woodsman introduced Elios to the individuals he would adventure with.

                    <p>
                        Vicar is a Half-Orc. Bastard son of a great lord (sort of), he was raised on chivalry. However, when his 
                        parents had a second child, he found himself cast to the wayside and the target of an assassination plot. 
                        He immediately set out for unknown shores, eventually making his way to Eriath. He joined a group of 
                        adventurers and ended up falling in love with an elf. After months of trying, he finally found a way to 
                        her heart. He then left the group to assist and travel with her.

                        a mystery to this day.
