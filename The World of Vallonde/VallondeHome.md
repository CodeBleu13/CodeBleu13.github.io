# Val'londe

Welcome to the World of Val'londe. 

## Recent History

Two major events have occured in the recent history of Val'londe. The bigger and earlier of the two events was a cateclysm that tore the world apart and caused the downfall of several empires across the world. In the wake of the cateclysm, many families were rent asunder. Entire communities dissapeared almost over night, whether by natural disaster or some other cause. Since the cateclysm, only 2 continents are "known" and connected, and kingdoms and nations are just begining to be able to reach the fiscal size to be able to begin full exploration. 

The more recent event to occur was known as The Tower Wars, a collosal world spanning war that began as an internal dispute within the Academy of Magic, known as the Towers of Magic, combined with a couple key assassinations and an attempt to sieze control of the weave, the fabric of magic around the world. The power grabing elements were eventually put down, however, not without the loss of many many lives. To date, many folks are still somewhat catious around magic, even though it permeates much of the world around them.

Alchemy (or, to be more precise, its more acane elements) and science are just reemerging, however, magic has a strong place in the world as well. There is some discussion of making alchemy a part of the schools of magic, but most, if not all, alchemists are opposed to this, prefering their own council and not trusing the established magical authority (The Towers of Magic).

## Time
There are a number of different ways of measuring the year, from the Druids’ Lunar Calendar to the Freast Calendar that spans 4 years. The most commonly used calendar is the Arthurian Calendar. The calendar of Val’londe is loosely based on the lunar cycle, with 365 days in the year. Each month takes 30 days, or 3 tendays, and the remaining 5 days fall on holidays that are not included in any month – the 2 equinoxes, the 2 solstice, and midsummers day. There are holidays sprinkled into the months as well, but those are incorporated into the particular day of the month. Every 4 years is a leap year, and an additional holiday is celebrated, taking place the day after Midsummer’s Day. The Garaemyx Calendar is also used in some areas, and survived the cataclysm from the First and Second Age. It closely follows the lunar cycle, having 13 months of 28 days each, and one free standing holiday, Midsummer’s Day. The Garaemyx Calendar is primarily used in abbeys by other religious groups, as well as by the alchemists.
