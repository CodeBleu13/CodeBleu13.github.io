## Review:

Origins is a much needed refreshment of hte AC series, and Ubisoft definately went above and beyond in their newest installment. The combat system was remade into something thoughtful and more involved than the previous combat systems, requiring more than the simple counterattack to defeat almost all enemies. The RPG shift of the game was wonderfull as well, making it my favorite title so far. The game is fantastically beautiful and very well put together visually. I did, however, have a couple of issues with the game. For one thing, the loading screens prior to cutscenes were hugely flowbreaking; the story would be progressing very nicely, then there would be a 2+ min load on a cutscene. On hard difficulty, the only real difference that I noticed from normal was being randomly attacked by roving bandits, and half the time, these attacks would come at the worst possible time; either duirng a sneaking section of a main mission, or during a stealth side mission where a gang of bandits would just inexplicably be ready and waiting and charge at you, alerting the previously calm enemies in the area. There was also a few moments where the combat felt very clunky and I ended up pretty much never using my shield throughout the course of the entire game. A critical feature, for me at least, is the Auto Level. I didn't use it in the first playthrough, but I did in the second, and it made a HUGE difference, keeping the game challenging throughout. While I didn't play through the DLCs a second time, I did enjoy them both. Of the two, the Pharoh DLC was the more fun of the two for me. I felt the Hidden Ones DLC was a little short (def shorter than expected). Emotionally, Origins was a roller coaster, with several unexpected twitsts and turns, even up to the end of the game. Oh. And the Snakes. Oh the snakes. Hate those things. They will mess you up, pretty much guarenteed. I wish I had a "death to snakes" counter. They, as well as the bowmen, definately made hard mode more difficult. I look forward to playing more and discovering even more hidden treasures.
