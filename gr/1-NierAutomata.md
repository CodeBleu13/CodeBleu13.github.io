## Review:

Very fun, very unpredictable RPG. The characters grow and evolve throughout the game. The characters you think are the protagonists and antagonists may not be who you think they are. The music compliments the game very well, although there were a few songs where the repetition got a little annoying, but other than that, the music was amazing. The boss fights were also very nuanced and can't all be solved entirely in the same way, making every fight unique. The game was also really good at asking deep, philosophical questions and forcing hard decisions on the player, like one involving a machine and an android. The emotions this game puts the player thorugh are incredible, as there are quite a few moments that will break the player's heart. Repeatedly. That being said, the story and content leave the player constantly wanting more and more and more. I really loved this game, far more than I thought I would. It deserved a Game of the Year award and I will be doing another playthough.
