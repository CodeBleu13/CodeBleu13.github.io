                        What am I playing right now? Glad you asked. I'm currently playing through a couple games. I'm playing <i>Hades</i> 
                        as well as completing my playthrough of <i>Pillars of Eternity</i>. I'm also playing through a couple other games 
                        at the same time as well, for the full list (and any of the mods) check out the Now Playing page!

                    <p>
                        Since December 2019, I began keeping track of the games I've completed and began reviewing them - and actually 
                        writing down those reviews. I typically write a simple one page review in my Lechuttum. I've begun digitizing 
                        them and they are listed here. Coming Soon&trade; video reviews where I discuss the game and provide my 
                        thoughts.

                    <h2><a href="BGA/BGA.md">Bleu Game Awards</a></h2>
                    <p> 
                        Starting in 2020, the Bleu Game Awards were created to nominate and celebrate games that were impactful and
                        meaningful to players, emphasizing not only new games, but also games that are older but finally getting played.
                        The BGAs are basically a response to a game award system that relies on the press and media and perhaps doesn't 
                        have the same perspective as the average consumer of games.
                    </p>

                        Streamed live Tuesdays, Campaign 2 takes place in the homebrew world of Val'londe, the same homebrew world as 
                        the first campaign. Campaign 1 spanned the course of 2 years and 35 episodes. Val'londe is a world that takes 
                        cues from many different fantasy worlds and mythologies, from the Old Norse Gods to the Forgotten Realms. Old 
                        episodes as well as some world information can be found here. For further world information, please feel free
