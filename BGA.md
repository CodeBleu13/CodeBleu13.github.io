I will eventually be putting the winners here, but in the meanwhile, a quick lessons learned as I update the rules for the future BGAs. The nominations are going to be prefilled with an 'other' option for write-ins, just to make things altogether easier. Furthermore, many categories are being removed from the quinquo section. These updates will be visible soon:tm:!!!
