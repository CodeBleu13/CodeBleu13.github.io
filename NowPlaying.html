                    <p> 
                        There are a couple of current games currently being played, here is the list (as well as some long term games
                        that I play off stream). I also keep track of the games I've beaten, review them, then post the reviews here.  
                        A link to the game reviews is below.

                    <h3>We Happy Few</h3>            
                    <p>
                        Having just finished <i>The Outer Worlds</i>, I felt like continuing with another RPG. We Happy Few is a fun 
                        game, with a very dark and depressing backstory/history and I'm excited to continue exploring the game to 
                        learn exactly what it is that has all the Wells habitents taking Joy. Also, what happened to Pru and who is 
                        Mr. Kite???

                    <h3>Hades</h3>            
                    <p>
                        I just started playing Hades for the first time on 2/19/21. The game is amazing. I've watched some people play
                        bits just to see if I would like the game before I bought it, but none of that prepared me for how much fun 
                        the game is when I'm the one playing it.
                    </p><p></p>
                    <h3>7 Days to Die</h3>            
                    <p>
                        7 Days is a survival game I recently started playing again thanks to watching a few streamers play it. It's 
                        a game I enjoy playing to relax and chill. I especially love the creativity I'm allowed in the game and 
                        the fact that structural integrity and gravity actually matter. I will play some 7 Days off stream, just 
                        becuase I do like relaxing with some building, but I try to at least stream the bloodmoons, if not some of 
                        the building and general looting that occurs.

                    <h3>FIFA</h3>            
                    <p>
                        I've enjoyed the FIFA games for a while, I actually have a few things I do with each one, each year. I build 
                        myself as a pro and work to become on the Chelsea first team, I manage Chelsea and take them to the top, 
                        typically using the current lineup and buying and selling players as needed after the first year, and, as a 
                        bit of a challenge to myself, this year I picked Colchester from the 4th tier of English Football and am 
                        working to bring them to the top of the world. I will play some matches off stream, just becuase I still 
                        have quite a few more games to play before becoming the world champions I intend to be.

                    <h3>Destiny 2</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have played Destiny since launch and I love the feel of the game. I often use Destiny to unwind as I get 
                        ready for bed. I enjoy playing both solo and with friends and frequently use Destiny as a chance to catch 
                        up with my friends and just relax and chill. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since December 2019, I began keeping track of the games I've completed and began reviewing them - and actually 
                        writing down those reviews. I typically write a simple one page review in my Lechuttum. I've begun digitizing 
                        them and they are listed here. Coming Soon&trade; video reviews where I discuss the game and provide my 
                        thoughts.
