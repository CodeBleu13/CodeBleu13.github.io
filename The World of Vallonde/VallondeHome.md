## Recent History

Two major events have occured in the recent history of Val'londe. The bigger and earlier of the two events was a cateclysm that tore the world apart and caused the downfall of several empires across the world. In the wake of the cateclysm, many families were rent asunder. Entire communities dissapeared almost over night, whether by natural disaster or some other cause. Since the cateclysm, only 2 continents are "known" and connected, and kingdoms and nations are just begining to be able to reach the fiscal size to be able to begin full exploration. 

The more recent event to occur was known as The Tower Wars, a collosal world spanning war that began as an internal dispute within the Academy of Magic, known as the Towers of Magic, combined with a couple key assassinations and an attempt to sieze control of the weave, the fabric of magic around the world. The power grabing elements were eventually put down, however, not without the loss of many many lives. To date, many folks are still somewhat catious around magic, even though it permeates much of the world around them.

Alchemy (or, to be more precise, its more acane elements) and science are just reemerging, however, magic has a strong place in the world as well. There is some discussion of making alchemy a part of the schools of magic, but most, if not all, alchemists are opposed to this, prefering their own council and not trusing the established magical authority (The Towers of Magic).
