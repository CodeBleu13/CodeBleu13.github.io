                    <p> 
                        There are a couple of current games currently being played, here is the list (as well as some long term games
                        that I play off stream). I also keep track of the games I've beaten, review them, then post the reviews here.  
                        A link to the game reviews is below.
                    </p>
                
                    <h2>Now Streaming:</h2><p></p>
                    <h3>Hades</h3>            
                    <p>
                        I just started playing Hades for the first time on 2/19/21. The game is amazing. I've watched some people play
                        bits just to see if I would like the game before I bought it, but none of that prepared me for how much fun 
                        the game is when I'm the one playing it.
                    </p><p></p>
                    <h3>Pillars of Eternity</h3>            
                    <p>
                        I started playing Pillars last year and made some good progress before I got sidetracked by other games. 
                        That being said, I'd really like to finish Pillars and play the sequel as well! I'm having quite a bit of fun 
                        not only in the story but also finding all of the voice actors who I can recognize in the game. The 
                        worldbuilding and lore in Pillars is astounding and very deep, something else I love in the games I play.
                    </p><p></p>
                    <h3>7 Days to Die</h3>            
                    <p>
                        7 Days is a survival game I recently started playing again thanks to watching a few streamers play it. It's 
                        a game I enjoy playing to relax and chill. I especially love the creativity I'm allowed in the game and 
                        the fact that structural integrity and gravity actually matter.
                    </p><p></p>
                    <h3>FIFA</h3>            
                    <p>
                        I've enjoyed the FIFA games for a while, I actually have a few things I do with each one, each year. I build 
                        myself as a pro and work to become on the Chelsea first team, I manage Chelsea and take them to the top, 
                        typically using the current lineup and buying and selling players as needed after the first year, and, as a 
                        bit of a challenge to myself, this year I picked Colchester from the 4th tier of English Football and am 
                        working to bring them to the top of the world.
                    </p><p></p>

                    <h3>Destiny 2</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have played Destiny since launch and I love the feel of the game. I often use Destiny to unwind as I get 
                        ready for bed. I enjoy playing both solo and with friends and frequently use Destiny as a chance to catch 
                        up with my friends and just relax and chill. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since December 2019, I began keeping track of the games I've completed and began reviewing them - and actually 
                        writing down those reviews. I typically write a simple one page review in my Lechuttum. I've begun digitizing 
                        them and they are listed here. Coming Soon&trade; video reviews where I discuss the game and provide my 
                        thoughts.
