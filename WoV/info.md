## Time
There are a number of different ways of measuring the year, from the Druids’ Lunar Calendar to the Freast Calendar that spans 4 years. The most commonly used calendar is the Arthurian Calendar. The calendar of Val’londe is loosely based on the lunar cycle, with 365 days in the year. Each month takes 30 days, or 3 tendays, and the remaining 5 days fall on holidays that are not included in any month – the 2 equinoxes, the 2 solstice, and midsummers day. There are holidays sprinkled into the months as well, but those are incorporated into the particular day of the month. Every 4 years is a leap year, and an additional holiday is celebrated, taking place the day after Midsummer’s Day. The Garaemyx Calendar is also used in some areas, and survived the cataclysm from the First and Second Age. It closely follows the lunar cycle, having 13 months of 28 days each, and one free standing holiday, Midsummer’s Day. The Garaemyx Calendar is primarily used in abbeys by other religious groups, as well as by the alchemists.
