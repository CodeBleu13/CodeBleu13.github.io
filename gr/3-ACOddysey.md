## Review:

I cannot say enough good about Odyssey. What a sequel to Origins!!! The story is huge and the player faces many choices and decisions from the very start. Visually, Odyssey is stunning. Naval battles are esstially perfect, the animals are great -> Boars are deadly though. Auto-level is absolutely neccesary and adds challenge to the game to keep the player engaged without destroying them. I fully played through the DLCs, playing the second DLC before the first on the advice of a friend who'd played through before. I'm very glad I did that, I will be doing that every time I play through, the result is being able to use special-leveled-up abilities while playing through the first DLC (basically giving me an opportunity to use them). I was not thrilled with being forced to having a child during the First Blade DLC, however, the story plays out decently well. The Atlantis DLC was amazing and I very much enjoyed it. I will be replaying this game and the DLCs in the future. Plot wise, my only advice is to be wary of your decisions as you could get one of your friends very very killed by your actions. Similar to Origins, Odyssey is an emotional rollercoaster, the problems and moral quandries parallel those in real life. PS - Watch out for the Boars.
