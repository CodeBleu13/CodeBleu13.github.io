                    <h1> About Me </h1>
                    <p> 
                        Hello there! My name is CodeBleu13, but please, call me Blue (or Bleu). I'm at the end of my 20s, use he/him
                        pronouns, and enjoy beer (not IPAs), gin, and scotch. I listen to music, and occasionally (always) revert back 
                        to my high school tastes in punk, rock, and oldies. And some folk music (like Mongolian Throat Singing or 
                        viking/old germanic inspired music). I enjoy playing games, especially RPGs, as well as the occasional strategy 
                        game. Oh, or survival game. Or simulation game. OR, or, open world game. Ok, so I'll play pretty much anything 
                        at least once. I typically enjoy streaming my first time playthroughs of games where I go in (mostly) without 
                        knowing much of anything about the game. I've found that I especially love games that involve making really 
                        tough decisions that have consequences down the line and agonizing over whether or not I've done the right thing. 
                        I also enjoy D&D and fantasy worlds and even created a homebrew D&D world in which I recently ran my first 
                        campaign as DM (Dungeon Master!) which actually just came to an end early in 2021. I live in Pennslyvania where, 
                        in a few months, I'll be marrying my best friend (super excited, but wedding planning is abysmal). I love 
                        pineapples, puns, and quesooooo (say it with a long drawn out 'o' sound). I've also been known to write the 
                        occasional parody song and then attempt to sing (very poorly) that song. I enjoy anime and am always open to 
                        suggestions for new ones to watch. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Outside streaming, I enjoyed (pre-plaguetimes) hanging out with friends and going out to places. I am a fishkeeper 
                        who has recently rediscovered their love of fishkeeping. I have 2 betta fish, named Glorfindel and Tai Li, that I
                        care for (in separate 10 gallon tanks), as well as their tank mates (neon tetras and ghost shrimp). I enjoy soccer 
                        (aka football) and follow a quite Blue team from London. In 2018, after working for 8 years in an Emergency 
                        Department of a Inner-city Level 1 Trauma Center, I decided to return to school, not for medicine, as I originally 
                        intended, but instead for Computer Science. In December of 2020, I graduated with my second Bachlors Degree. I 
                        actually found a huge love for data, and even have a special project that involves gaming and data that I love. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my free time, I also enjoy modular origami, Something I forgot, but no worries, problem for Future Bleu.
