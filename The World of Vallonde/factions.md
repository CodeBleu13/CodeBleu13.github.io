# The Factions and Organizations


-------------------------------------------
## The Harper Order (The Order of Assassins)
The Harpers are an old organization that has risen, been shattered, and risen again several times. Its longevity and resilience are largely due to its decentralized, grassroots, secretive nature, and the near-autonomy of many of its members. The Harpers have “cells” and lone operatives throughout the land, although they interact and share information with one another from time to time as needs warrant. The Harpers' ideology is noble, and its members pride themselves on their integrity and incorruptibility. Harpers do not seek power or glory, only fair and equal treatment for all.

Harper agents are trained to act alone and depend on their own resources. When they get into scrapes, they don’t count on their fellow Harpers to rescue them. Nevertheless, Harpers are dedicated to helping one another in times of need, and friendships between Harpers are nigh unbreakable. Masterful spies and infiltrators, they use various guises and secret identities to form relationships, cultivate their information networks, and manipulate others into doing what needs to be done. Although most Harpers prefer to operate in the shadows, there are exceptions.

Harpers have been known to infiltrate every court and city possible, in order to maintain their work. The Harpers are often confused with the Assassin Order; however, the Assassin Order is a subgroup that operates within the Harpers Organization.  The Assassin Order is not the same as the Guild of Assassins, and while someone may be a member of both organizations, both are very independent of each other, and not just anyone is allowed within the Assassin Order.  Ranks within the Assassin Order also line up with Harper Ranks, and typically, though not always, an assassin, upon reaching the rank of Grand Master, also gets promoted to High Harper.

The Council of High Harpers is typically how important information is passed between different regions of Val’londe.  They meet irregularly, though they communicate to each other with letters and notes delivered through other harper agents.  Any individual introduced to the High Harper rank comes from approval from a simple majority of the Council of High Harpers, and also requires an endorsement of a High Harper to even be considered.  As yet, there has never been a close vote, and no High Harper candidate has ever been refused the rank.

### Beliefs
1.	One can never have too much information.
2.	Too much power leads to corruption.
3.	No one should be powerless.

### Goals
To gather information throughout, discern the political dynamics within each region or realm, and promote fairness and equality by covert means. Act openly as a last resort. Thwart tyrants and any leader, government, or group that grows too powerful, and aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed.

## The Dragon Riders

The Dragon Riders is an ancient order that once patrolled the entire world of Val’londe.  They were decimated during the last cataclysm, and have since retreated from most parts of the world as a result.  They are occasionally seen in the far north, where few people live.  The Dragon Riders now live a mostly insular life, becoming almost a monastic order.  The few who still remember who they are and where to find them typically contract them to take care of great beasts and to investigate mysteries.  Present day Dragon Riders do not have a pet dragons, though they’ll have the occasional draconic companion.
Not much is known about the Dragon Riders, save for those within the organization.  Entry is not a casual acceptance, but a complete change of life, typically from a very young age.  It is rumored that Dragon Riders have some kind of access to incredibly long life, to the point where they are almost immortal, regardless of race.  They have been known to work with the Harpers, and are frequently contacted by the Harpers.  However, most Harper records have been lost during the last cataclysm, so information is limited.  What is known is that the Dragon Riders were the known authority in a significant portion of the continent of _____qw_______.  They did not rule any countries themselves, they merely kept the peace and were used to resolve border disputes and other squabbles.  The head of the order is called the Pendragon, and is elected from mentors, the outgoing Pendragon chooses someone, then any other candidates are proposed by the mentors.  It is then put to vote, and all mentors and Drakes vote.  The candidate with the most votes wins.  In event of a tie, the tied candidates get a runoff election where they are the only names that can be voted upon.
Dragons themselves are not a source of information about the Dragon Riders, as they are suspiciously quiet or try to change topics every time the subject is broached.  They refuse to even allow speculation about the Dragon Riders in their presence.  A couple of intrepid adventurers have found oddly colored scales, and, upon further examination, revealed a third category of Dragon: Crystalline.  It appears the crystalline dragons can have any alignment, and depends on the Rider they are paired with.  

### Beliefs
1.	Ultimate power corrupts absolutely.
2.	No one person should have all of the power.
3.	The role of governments and rulers is to maintain peace and justice.
4.	All people have the right to be free

### Goals
To provide a medium for governments to be able to sort their disagreements and promote peace.  Furthermore, to protect people from tyranny and tyrants, as well as from enslavement. Diplomacy is always the first line of action, but, if necessary, use force to defend others.
