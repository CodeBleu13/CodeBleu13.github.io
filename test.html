                    <p>
                        Since December 2019, I began keeping track of the games I've completed and began reviewing them - and actually 
                        writing down those reviews. I typically write a simple one page review in my Lechuttum. I've begun digitizing 
                        them and they are listed here. Coming Soon&trade; video reviews where I discuss the game and provide my 
                        thoughts.

                    <h2><a href="BGA.md">Bleu Game Awards</a></h2>
                    <p> 
                        Starting in 2020, the Bleu Game Awards were created to nominate and celebrate games that were impactful and
                        meaningful to players, emphasizing not only new games, but also games that are older but finally getting played.
                        The BGAs are basically a response to a game award system that relies on the press and media and perhaps doesn't 
                        have the same perspective as the average consumer of games.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Spanning over the course of 2 years and 35 episodes, the first campaign was a homebrew campaign constructed in 
                        a world that I built called Val'londe. Val'londe is a world that took cues from many different fantasy worlds
                        and mythologies. Old episodes as well as world information can be found here. For further world information, 
                        please feel free to contact me!
