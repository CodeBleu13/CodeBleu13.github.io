                    <p>
                        Very fun, very unpredictable RPG. The characters grow and evolve throughout the game. The characters you think 
                        are the protagonists and antagonists may not be who you think they are. The music compliments the game very 
                        well, although there were a few songs where the repetition got a little annoying, but other than that, the 
                        music was amazing. The boss fights were also very nuanced and can't all be solved entirely in the same way, 
                        making every fight unique. The game was also really good at asking deep, philosophical questions and forcing 
                        hard decisions on the player, like one involving a machine and an android. The emotions this game puts the 
                        player thorugh are incredible, as there are quite a few moments that will break the player's heart. Repeatedly. 
                        That being said, the story and content leave the player constantly wanting more and more and more. I really 
                        loved this game, far more than I thought I would. It deserved a Game of the Year award and I will be doing 
                        another playthough.
